<h2>
    CHAPTER I
</h2>
<p>
    The ancient port of Sunwich was basking in the sunshine of a July
    afternoon.  A rattle of cranes and winches sounded from the shipping in
    the harbour, but the town itself was half asleep.  Somnolent shopkeepers
    in dim back parlours coyly veiled their faces in red handkerchiefs from
    the too ardent flies, while small boys left in charge noticed listlessly
    the slow passing of time as recorded by the church clock.
</p>
<p>
    It is a fine church, and Sunwich is proud of it.  The tall grey tower is
    a landmark at sea, but from the narrow streets of the little town itself
    it has a disquieting appearance of rising suddenly above the roofs
    huddled beneath it for the purpose of displaying a black-faced clock with
    gilt numerals whose mellow chimes have recorded the passing hours for
    many generations of Sunwich men.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of the heat, which indeed was mild compared with that which
    raged in his own bosom, Captain Nugent, fresh from the inquiry of the
    collision of his ship <i>Conqueror</i> with the German barque <i>Hans Muller</i>,
    strode rapidly up the High Street in the direction of home.  An honest
    seafaring smell, compounded of tar, rope, and fish, known to the educated
    of Sunwich as ozone, set his thoughts upon the sea.  He longed to be
    aboard ship again, with the Court of Inquiry to form part of his crew.
    In all his fifty years of life he had never met such a collection of
    fools.  His hard blue eyes blazed as he thought of them, and the mouth
    hidden by his well-kept beard was set with anger.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Samson Wilks, his steward, who had been with him to London to give
    evidence, had had a time upon which he looked back in later years with
    much satisfaction at his powers of endurance.  He was with the captain,
    and yet not with him.  When they got out of the train at Sunwich he
    hesitated as to whether he should follow the captain or leave him.  His
    excuse for following was the bag, his reason for leaving the volcanic
    condition of its owner's temper, coupled with the fact that he appeared
    to be sublimely ignorant that the most devoted steward in the world was
    tagging faithfully along a yard or two in the rear.
</p>
<p>
    The few passers-by glanced at the couple with interest.  Mr. Wilks had
    what is called an expressive face, and he had worked his sandy eyebrows,
    his weak blue eyes, and large, tremulous mouth into such an expression of
    surprise at the finding of the Court, that he had all the appearance of a
    beholder of visions.  He changed the bag to his other hand as they left
    the town behind them, and regarded with gratitude the approaching end of
    his labours.
</p>
<p>
    At the garden-gate of a fair-sized house some half-mile along the road
    the captain stopped, and after an impatient fumbling at the latch strode
    up the path, followed by Mr. Wilks, and knocked at the door.  As he
    paused on the step he half turned, and for the first time noticed the
    facial expression of his faithful follower.
</p>
<p>
    "What the dickens are you looking like that for?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "I've been surprised, sir," conceded Mr. Wilks; "surprised and
    astonished."
</p>
<p>
    Wrath blazed again in the captain's eyes and set lines in his forehead.
    He was being pitied by a steward!
</p>
<p>
    "You've been drinking," he said, crisply; "put that bag down."
</p>
<p>
    "Arsking your pardon, sir," said the steward, twisting his unusually dry
    lips into a smile, "but I've 'ad no opportunity, sir&mdash;I've been follerin'
    you all day, sir."
</p>
<p>
    A servant opened the door.  "You've been soaking in it for a month,"
    declared the captain as he entered the hall.  "Why the blazes don't you
    bring that bag in?  Are you so drunk you don't know what you are doing?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks picked the bag up and followed humbly into the house.  Then he
    lost his head altogether, and gave some colour to his superior officer's
    charges by first cannoning into the servant and then wedging the captain
    firmly in the doorway of the sitting-room with the bag.
</p>
<p>
    "Steward!" rasped the captain.
</p>
<p>
    "Yessir," said the unhappy Mr. Wilks.
</p>
<p>
    "Go and sit down in the kitchen, and don't leave this house till you're
    sober."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks disappeared.  He was not in his first lustre, but he was an
    ardent admirer of the sex, and in an absent-minded way he passed his arm
    round the handmaiden's waist, and sustained a buffet which made his head
    ring.
</p>
<p>
    "A man o' your age, and drunk, too," explained the damsel.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks denied both charges.  It appeared that he was much younger than
    he looked, while, as for drink, he had forgotten the taste of it.  A
    question as to the reception Ann would have accorded a boyish teetotaler
    remained unanswered.
</p>
<p>
    In the sitting-room Mrs. Kingdom, the captain's widowed sister, put down
    her crochet-work as her brother entered, and turned to him expectantly.
    There was an expression of loving sympathy on her mild and rather foolish
    face, and the captain stiffened at once.
</p>
<p>
    "I was in the wrong," he said, harshly, as he dropped into a chair; "my
    certificate has been suspended for six months, and my first officer has
    been commended."
</p>
<p>
    "Suspended?" gasped Mrs. Kingdom, pushing back the white streamer to the
    cap which she wore in memory of the late Mr. Kingdom, and sitting
    upright.  You?"
</p>
<p>
    "I think that's what I said," replied her brother.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Kingdom gazed at him mournfully, and, putting her hand behind her,
    began a wriggling search in her pocket for a handkerchief, with the idea
    of paying a wholesome tribute of tears.  She was a past-master in the art
    of grief, and, pending its extraction, a docile tear hung on her eyelid
    and waited.  The captain eyed her preparations with silent anger.
</p>
<p>
    "I am not surprised," said Mrs. Kingdom, dabbing her eyes; "I expected it
    somehow.  I seemed to have a warning of it.  Something seemed to tell me;
    I couldn't explain, but I seemed to know."
</p>
<p>
    She sniffed gently, and, wiping one eye at a time, kept the disengaged
    one charged with sisterly solicitude upon her brother.  The captain, with
    steadily rising anger, endured this game of one-eyed bo-peep for five
    minutes; then he rose and, muttering strange things in his beard, stalked
    upstairs to his room.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Kingdom, thus forsaken, dried her eyes and resumed her work.  The
    remainder of the family were in the kitchen ministering to the wants of a
    misunderstood steward, and, in return, extracting information which
    should render them independent of the captain's version.
</p>
<p>
    "Was it very solemn, Sam?" inquired Miss Nugent, aged nine, who was
    sitting on the kitchen table.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks used his hands and eyebrows to indicate the solemnity of the
    occasion.
</p>
<p>
    "They even made the cap'n leave off speaking," he said, in an awed voice.
</p>
<p>
    "I should have liked to have been there," said Master Nugent, dutifully.
</p>
<p>
    "Ann," said Miss Nugent, "go and draw Sam a jug of beer."
</p>
<p>
    "Beer, Miss?" said Ann.
</p>
<p>
    "A jug of beer," repeated Miss Nugent, peremptorily.
</p>
<p>
    Ann took a jug from the dresser, and Mr. Wilks, who was watching her,
    coughed helplessly.  His perturbation attracted the attention of his
    hostess, and, looking round for the cause, she was just in time to see
    Ann disappearing into the larder with a cream jug.
</p>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "The big jug, Ann," she said, impatiently; "you ought to know Sam would
    like a big one."
</p>
<p>
    Ann changed the jugs, and, ignoring a mild triumph in Mr. Wilks's eye,
    returned to the larder, whence ensued a musical trickling.  Then Miss
    Nugent, raising the jug with some difficulty, poured out a tumbler for
    the steward with her own fair hands.
</p>
<p>
    "Sam likes beer," she said, speaking generally.
</p>
<p>
    "I knew that the first time I see him, Miss," re-marked the vindictive
    Ann.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks drained his glass and set it down on the table again, making a
    feeble gesture of repulse as Miss Nugent refilled it.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on, Sam," she said, with kindly encouragement; "how much does this
    jug hold, Jack?"
</p>
<p>
    "Quart," replied her brother.
</p>
<p>
    "How many quarts are there in a gallon?"
</p>
<p>
    "Four."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Nugent looked troubled.  "I heard father say he drinks gallons a
    day," she remarked; "you'd better fill all the jugs, Ann."
</p>
<p>
    "It was only 'is way o' speaking," said Mr. Wilks, hurriedly; "the cap'n
    is like that sometimes."
</p>
<p>
    "I knew a man once, Miss," said Ann, "as used to prefer to 'ave it in a
    wash-hand basin.  Odd, ugly-looking man 'e was; like Mr. Wilks in the
    face, only better-looking."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks sat upright and, in the mental struggle involved in taking in
    this insult in all its ramifications, did not notice until too late that
    Miss Nugent had filled his glass again.
</p>
<p>
    "It must ha' been nice for the captain to 'ave you with 'im to-day,"
    remarked Ann, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
    "It was," said Mr. Wilks, pausing with the glass at his lips and eyeing
    her sternly.  "Eighteen years I've bin with 'im&mdash;ever since 'e 'ad a
    ship.  'E took a fancy to me the fust time 'e set eyes on me."
</p>
<p>
    "Were you better-looking then, Sam?" inquired Miss Nugent, shuffling
    closer to him on the table and regarding him affectionately.
</p>
<p>
    "Much as I am now, Miss," replied Mr. Wilks, setting down his glass and
    regarding Ann's giggles with a cold eye.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Nugent sighed.  "I love you, Sam," she said, simply.  "Will you have
    some more beer?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks declined gracefully.  "Eighteen years I've bin with the cap'n,"
    he remarked, softly; "through calms and storms, fair weather and foul,
    Samson Wilks 'as been by 'is side, always ready in a quiet and 'umble way
    to do 'is best for 'im, and now&mdash;now that 'e is on his beam-ends and lost
    'is ship, Samson Wilks'll sit down and starve ashore till he gets
    another."
</p>
<p>
    At these touching words Miss Nugent was undisguisedly affected, and
    wiping her bright eyes with her pinafore, gave her small, well-shaped
    nose a slight touch <i>en passant</i> with the same useful garment, and
    squeezed his arm affectionately.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a lively look-out for me if father is going to be at home for
    long," remarked Master Nugent.  Who'll get his ship, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "Shouldn't wonder if the fust officer, Mr. Hardy, got it," replied the
    steward.  "He was going dead-slow in the fog afore he sent down to rouse
    your father, and as soon as your father came on deck 'e went at
    'arfspeed.  Mr. Hardy was commended, and your father's certifikit was
    suspended for six months."
</p>
<p>
    Master Nugent whistled thoughtfully, and quitting the kitchen proceeded
    upstairs to his room, and first washing himself with unusual care for a
    boy of thirteen, put on a clean collar and brushed his hair.  He was not
    going to provide a suspended master-mariner with any obvious reasons for
    fault-finding.  While he was thus occupied the sitting-room bell rang,
    and Ann, answering it, left Mr. Wilks in the kitchen listening with some
    trepidation to the conversation.
</p>
<p>
    "Is that steward of mine still in the kitchen?" demanded the captain,
    gruffly.
</p>
<p>
    "Yessir," said Ann.
</p>
<p>
    "What's he doing?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks's ears quivered anxiously, and he eyed with unwonted disfavour
    the evidences of his late debauch.
</p>
<p>
    "Sitting down, sir," replied Ann.
</p>
<p>
    "Give him a glass of ale and send him off," commanded the captain; "and
    if that was Miss Kate I heard talking, send her in to me."
</p>
<p>
    Ann took the message back to the kitchen and, with the air of a martyr
    engaged upon an unpleasant task, drew Mr. Wilks another glass of ale and
    stood over him with well-affected wonder while he drank it.  Miss Nugent
    walked into the sitting-room, and listening in a perfunctory fashion to a
    shipmaster's platitude on kitchen-company, took a seat on his knee and
    kissed his ear.

    CHAPTER II
</h2>
<p>
    The downfall of Captain Nugent was for some time a welcome subject of
    conversation in marine circles at Sunwich.  At The Goblets, a rambling
    old inn with paved courtyard and wooden galleries, which almost backed on
    to the churchyard, brother-captains attributed it to an error of
    judgment; at the Two Schooners on the quay the profanest of sailormen
    readily attributed it to an all-seeing Providence with a dislike of
    over-bearing ship-masters.

<p>
    The captain's cup was filled to the brim by the promotion of his first
    officer to the command of the <i>Conqueror</i>.  It was by far the largest
    craft which sailed from the port of Sunwich, and its master held a
    corresponding dignity amongst the captains of lesser vessels.  Their
    allegiance was now transferred to Captain Hardy, and the master of a brig
    which was in the last stages of senile decay, meeting Nugent in The
    Goblets, actually showed him by means of two lucifer matches how the
    collision might have been avoided.
</p>
<p>
    A touching feature in the business, and a source of much gratification to
    Mr. Wilks by the sentimental applause evoked by it, was his renunciation
    of the post of steward on the ss. <i>Conqueror</i>.  Sunwich buzzed with the
    tidings that after eighteen years' service with Captain Nugent he
    preferred starvation ashore to serving under another master.  Although
    comfortable in pocket and known to be living with his mother, who kept a
    small general shop, he was regarded as a man on the brink of starvation.
    Pints were thrust upon him, and the tale of his nobility increased with
    much narration.  It was considered that the whole race of stewards had
    acquired fresh lustre from his action.
</p>
<p>
    His only unfavourable critic was the erring captain himself.  He sent
    a peremptory summons to Mr. Wilks to attend at Equator Lodge, and the
    moment he set eyes upon that piece of probity embarked upon such a
    vilification of his personal defects and character as Mr. Wilks had never
    even dreamt of.  He wound up by ordering him to rejoin the ship
    forthwith.
</p>
<p>
    "Arsking your pardon, sir," said Mr. Wilks, with tender reproach, "but I
    couldn't."
</p>
<p>
    "Are you going to live on your mother, you hulking rascal?" quoth the
    incensed captain.
</p>
<p>
    "No, sir," said Mr. Wilks.  "I've got a little money, sir; enough for my
    few wants till we sail again."
</p>
<p>
    "When I sail again you won't come with me," said the captain, grimly.
    "I suppose you want an excuse for a soak ashore for six months!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks twiddled his cap in his hands and smiled weakly.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought p'r'aps as you'd like me to come round and wait at table, and
    help with the knives and boots and such-like," he said, softly.  "Ann is
    agreeable."
</p>
<p>
    "Get out of the house," said the captain in quiet, measured tones.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks went, but on his way to the gate he picked up three pieces of
    paper which had blown into the garden, weeded two pieces of grass from
    the path, and carefully removed a dead branch from a laurel facing the
    window.  He would have done more but for an imperative knocking on the
    glass, and he left the premises sadly, putting his collection of rubbish
    over the next garden fence as he passed it.
</p>
<p>
    But the next day the captain's boots bore such a polish that he was able
    to view his own startled face in them, and at dinner-time the brightness
    of the knives was so conspicuous that Mrs. Kingdom called Ann in for the
    purpose of asking her why she didn't always do them like that.  Her
    brother ate his meal in silence, and going to his room afterwards
    discovered every pair of boots he possessed, headed by the tall
    sea-boots, standing in a nicely graduated line by the wall, and all
    shining their hardest.
</p>
<p>
    For two days did Mr. Wilks do good by stealth, leaving Ann to blush to
    find it fame; but on the third day at dinner, as the captain took up his
    knife and fork to carve, he became aware of a shadow standing behind his
    chair.  A shadow in a blue coat with metal buttons, which, whipping up
    the first plate carved, carried it to Mrs. Kingdom, and then leaned
    against her with the vegetable dishes.
</p>
<p>
    The dishes clattered a little on his arm as he helped the captain, but
    the latter, after an impressive pause and a vain attempt to catch the eye
    of Mr. Wilks, which was intent upon things afar off, took up the spoon
    and helped himself.  From the unwonted silence of Miss Nugent in the
    presence of anything unusual it was clear to him that the whole thing had
    been carefully arranged.  He ate in silence, and a resolution to kick Mr.
    Wilks off the premises vanished before the comfort, to say nothing of the
    dignity, afforded by his presence.  Mr. Wilks, somewhat reassured,
    favoured Miss Nugent with a wink to which, although she had devoted much
    time in trying to acquire the art, she endeavoured in vain to respond.
</p>
<p>
    It was on the day following this that Jack Nugent, at his sister's
    instigation, made an attempt to avenge the family honour.  Miss Nugent,
    although she treated him with scant courtesy herself, had a touching
    faith in his prowess, a faith partly due to her brother occasionally
    showing her his bicep muscles in moments of exaltation.
</p>
<p>
    "There's that horrid Jem Hardy," she said, suddenly, as they walked along
    the road.
</p>
<p>
    "So it is," said Master Nugent, but without any display of enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
    "Halloa, Jack," shouted Master Hardy across the road.
</p>
<p>
    "The suspense became painful."
</p>
<p>
    "Halloa," responded the other.
</p>
<p>
    "He's going to fight you," shrilled Miss Nugent, who thought these
    amenities ill-timed; "he said so."
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy crossed the road.  "What for?" he demanded, with surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Because you're a nasty, horrid boy," replied Miss Nugent, drawing
    herself up.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh," said Master Hardy, blankly.
</p>
<p>
    The two gentlemen stood regarding each other with uneasy grins; the lady
    stood by in breathless expectation.  The suspense became painful.

<p>
    "Who are you staring at?"  demanded Master Nugent, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "You," replied the other; "who are you staring at?"
</p>
<p>
    "You," said Master Nugent, defiantly.
</p>
<p>
    There was a long interval, both gentlemen experiencing some difficulty in
    working up sufficient heat for the engagement.
</p>
<p>
    "You hit me and see what you'll get," said Master Hardy, at length.
</p>
<p>
    "You hit me," said the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Cowardy, cowardy custard," chanted the well-bred Miss Nugent, "ate his
    mother's mustard.  Cowardy, cowardy cus&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't you send that kid home?" demanded Master Hardy, eyeing the
    fair songstress with strong disfavour.
</p>
<p>
    "You leave my sister alone," said the other, giving him a light tap on
    the shoulder.  "There's your coward's blow."
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy made a ceremonious return.  "There's yours," he said.
    "Let's go behind the church."
</p>
<p>
    His foe assented, and they proceeded in grave silence to a piece of grass
    screened by trees, which stood between the church and the beach.  Here
    they removed their coats and rolled up their shirt-sleeves.  Things look
    different out of doors, and to Miss Nugent the arms of both gentlemen
    seemed somewhat stick-like in their proportions.
</p>
<p>
    The preliminaries were awful, both combatants prancing round each other
    with their faces just peering above their bent right arms, while their
    trusty lefts dealt vicious blows at the air.  Miss Nugent turned pale and
    caught her breath at each blow, then she suddenly reddened with wrath as
    James Philip Hardy, having paid his tribute to science, began to hammer
    John Augustus Nugent about the face in a most painful and workmanlike
    fashion.
</p>
<p>
    She hid her face for a moment, and when she looked again Jack was on the
    ground, and Master Hardy just rising from his prostrate body.  Then Jack
    rose slowly and, crossing over to her, borrowed her handkerchief and
    applied it with great tenderness to his nose.
</p>
<p>
    "Does it hurt, Jack?" she inquired, anxiously.  "No," growled her
    brother.
</p>
<p>
    He threw down the handkerchief and turned to his opponent again; Miss
    Nugent, who was careful about her property, stooped to recover it, and
    immediately found herself involved in a twisting tangle of legs, from
    which she escaped by a miracle to see Master Hardy cuddling her brother
    round the neck with one hand and punching him as hard and as fast as he
    could with the other.  The unfairness of it maddened her, and the next
    moment Master Hardy's head was drawn forcibly backwards by the hair.  The
    pain was so excruciating that he released his victim at once, and Miss
    Nugent, emitting a series of terrified yelps, dashed off in the direction
    of home, her hair bobbing up and down on her shoulders, and her small
    black legs in an ecstasy of motion.
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy, with no very well-defined ideas of what he was going to do
    if he caught her, started in pursuit.  His scalp was still smarting and
    his eyes watering with the pain as he pounded behind her.  Panting wildly
    she heard him coming closer and closer, and she was just about to give up
    when, to her joy, she saw her father coming towards them.
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy, intent on his quarry, saw him just in time, and, swerving
    into the road, passed in safety as Miss Nugent flung herself with some
    violence at her father's waistcoat and, clinging to him convulsively,
    fought for breath.  It was some time before she could furnish the
    astonished captain with full details, and she was pleased to find that
    his indignation led him to ignore the hair-grabbing episode, on which,
    to do her justice, she touched but lightly.
</p>
<p>
    That evening, for the first time in his life, Captain Nugent, after some
    deliberation, called upon his late mate.  The old servant who, since Mrs.
    Hardy's death the year before, had looked after the house, was out, and
    Hardy, unaware of the honour intended him, was scandalized by the manner
    in which his son received the visitor.  The door opened, there was an
    involuntary grunt from Master Hardy, and the next moment he sped along
    the narrow passage and darted upstairs.  His father, after waiting in
    vain for his return, went to the door himself.
</p>
<p>
    "Good evening, cap'n," he said, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
    Nugent responded gruffly, and followed him into the sitting-room.  To an
    invitation to sit, he responded more gruffly still that he preferred to
    stand.  He then demanded instant and sufficient punishment of Master
    Hardy for frightening his daughter.
</p>
<p>
    Even as he spoke he noticed with strong disfavour the change which had
    taken place in his late first officer.  The change which takes place when
    a man is promoted from that rank to that of master is subtle, but
    unmistakable&mdash;sometimes, as in the present instance, more unmistakable
    than subtle.  Captain Hardy coiled his long, sinewy form in an arm-chair
    and, eyeing him calmly, lit his pipe before replying.
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "Boys will fight," he said, briefly.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm speaking of his running after my daughter," said Nugent, sternly.
</p>
<p>
    Hardy's eyes twinkled.  "Young dog," he said, genially; "at his age,
    too."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nugent's face was suffused with wrath at the pleasantry, and he
    regarded him with a fixed stare.  On board the <i>Conqueror</i> there was a
    witchery in that glance more potent than the spoken word, but in his own
    parlour the new captain met it calmly.
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't come here to listen to your foolery," said Nugent; "I came to
    tell you to punish that boy of yours."
</p>
<p>
    "And I sha'n't do it," replied the other.  "I have got something better
    to do than interfere in children's quarrels.  I haven't got your spare
    time, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nugent turned purple.  Such language from his late first officer
    was a revelation to him.
</p>
<p>
    "I also came to warn you," he said, furiously, "that I shall take the law
    into my own hands if you refuse."
</p>
<p>
    "Aye, aye," said Hardy, with careless contempt; "I'll tell him to keep
    out of your way.  But I should advise you to wait until I have sailed."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nugent, who was moving towards the door, swung round and
    confronted him savagely.
</p>
<p>
    "What do you mean?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "What I say," retorted Captain Hardy.  "I don't want to indulge Sunwich
    with the spectacle of two middle-aged ship-masters at fisticuffs, but
    that's what'll happen if you touch my boy.  It would probably please the
    spectators more than it would us."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll cane him the first time I lay hands on him," roared Captain Nugent.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hardy's stock of patience was at an end, and there was, moreover,
    a long and undischarged account between himself and his late skipper.  He
    rose and crossed to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Jem," he cried, "come downstairs and show Captain Nugent out."
</p>
<p>
    There was a breathless pause.  Captain Nugent ground his teeth with fury
    as he saw the challenge, and realized the ridiculous position into which
    his temper had led him; and the other, who was also careful of
    appearances, repented the order the moment he had given it.  Matters had
    now, however, passed out of their hands, and both men cast appraising
    glances at each other's form.  The only one who kept his head was Master
    Hardy, and it was a source of considerable relief to both of them when,
    from the top of the stairs, the voice of that youthful Solomon was heard
    declining in the most positive terms to do anything of the kind.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hardy repeated his command.  The only reply was the violent
    closing of a door at the top of the house, and after waiting a short time
    he led the way to the front door himself.
</p>
<p>
    "You will regret your insolence before I have done with you," said his
    visitor, as he paused on the step.  "It's the old story of a beggar on
    horseback."
</p>
<p>
    "It's a good story," said Captain Hardy, "but to my mind it doesn't come
    up to the one about Humpty-Dumpty.  Good-night."

<h2>
    CHAPTER III
</h2>
<p>
    If anything was wanted to convince Captain Nugent that his action had
    been foolish and his language intemperate it was borne in upon him by the
    subsequent behaviour of Master Hardy.  Generosity is seldom an attribute
    of youth, while egotism, on the other hand, is seldom absent.  So far
    from realizing that the captain would have scorned such lowly game,
    Master Hardy believed that he lived for little else, and his
    Jack-in-the-box ubiquity was a constant marvel and discomfort to that
    irritable mariner.  Did he approach a seat on the beach, it was Master
    Hardy who rose (at the last moment) to make room for him.  Did he stroll
    down to the harbour, it was in the wake of a small boy looking coyly at
    him over his shoulder.  Every small alley as he passed seemed to contain
    a Jem Hardy, who whizzed out like a human firework in front of him, and
    then followed dancing on his toes a pace or two in his rear.
</p>
<p>
    This was on week-days; on the Sabbath Master Hardy's daring ingenuity led
    him to still further flights.  All the seats at the parish church were
    free, but Captain Nugent, whose admirable practice it was to take his
    entire family to church, never thoroughly realized how free they were
    until Master Hardy squeezed his way in and, taking a seat next to him,
    prayed with unwonted fervour into the interior of a new hat, and then
    sitting back watched with polite composure the efforts of Miss Nugent's
    family to re-strain her growing excitement.
</p>
<p>
    Charmed with the experiment, he repeated it the following Sunday.  This
    time he boarded the seat from the other end, and seeing no place by the
    captain, took one, or more correctly speaking made one, between Miss
    Nugent and Jack, and despite the former's elbow began to feel almost like
    one of the family.  Hostile feelings vanished, and with an amiable smile
    at the half-frantic Miss Nugent he placed a "bull's-eye" of great
    strength in his cheek, and leaning forward for a hymn-book left one on
    the ledge in front of jack.  A double-distilled perfume at once assailed
    the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Nugent sat dazed at his impudence, and for the first time in her
    life doubts as to her father's capacity stirred within her.  She
    attempted the poor consolation of an "acid tablet," and it was at
    once impounded by the watchful Mrs. Kingdom.  Mean-time the reek of
    "bull's-eyes" was insufferable.
</p>
<p>
    The service seemed interminable, and all that time the indignant damsel,
    wedged in between her aunt and the openly exultant enemy of her House,
    was compelled to endure in silence.  She did indeed attempt one remark,
    and Master Hardy, with a horrified expression of outraged piety, said
    "H'sh," and shook his head at her.  It was almost more than flesh and
    blood could bear, and when the unobservant Mrs. Kingdom asked her for the
    text on the way home her reply nearly cost her the loss of her dinner.
</p>
<p>
    The <i>Conqueror,</i> under its new commander, sailed on the day following.
    Mr. Wilks watched it from the quay, and the new steward observing him
    came to the side, and holding aloft an old pantry-cloth between his
    finger and thumb until he had attracted his attention, dropped it
    overboard with every circumstance of exaggerated horror.  By the time a
    suitable retort had occurred to the ex-steward the steamer was half a
    mile distant, and the extraordinary and unnatural pantomime in which he
    indulged on the edge of the quay was grievously misinterpreted by a
    nervous man in a sailing boat.
</p>
<a name="image-5"><!--IMG--></a>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Master Hardy had also seen the ship out, and, perched on the extreme end
    of the breakwater, he remained watching until she was hull down on the
    horizon.  Then he made his way back to the town and the nearest
    confectioner, and started for home just as Miss Nugent, who was about
    to pay a call with her aunt, waited, beautifully dressed, in the front
    garden while that lady completed her preparations.
</p>
<p>
    Feeling very spic and span, and still a trifle uncomfortable from the
    vigorous attentions of Ann, who cleansed her as though she had been a
    doorstep, she paced slowly up and down the path.  Upon these occasions of
    high dress a spirit of Sabbath calm was wont to descend upon her and save
    her from escapades to which in a less severe garb she was somewhat prone.
</p>
<p>
    She stopped at the gate and looked up the road.  Then her face flushed,
    and she cast her eyes behind her to make sure that the hall-door stood
    open.  The hated scion of the house of Hardy was coming down the road,
    and, in view of that fact, she forgot all else&mdash;even her manners.
</p>
<p>
    The boy, still fresh from the loss of his natural protector, kept a wary
    eye on the house as he approached.  Then all expression died out of his
    face, and he passed the gate, blankly ignoring the small girl who was
    leaning over it and apparently suffering from elephantiasis of the
    tongue.  He went by quietly, and Miss Nugent, raging inwardly that she
    had misbehaved to no purpose, withdrew her tongue for more legitimate
    uses.
</p>
<p>
    "Boo," she cried; "who had his hair pulled?"
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy pursued the even tenor of his way.
</p>
<p>
    "Who's afraid to answer me for fear my father will thrash him?" cried the
    disappointed lady, raising her voice.
</p>
<p>
    This was too much.  The enemy retraced his steps and came up to the gate.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a rude little girl," he said, with an insufferably grown-up air.
</p>
<p>
    "Who had his hair pulled?" demanded Miss Nugent, capering wildly; "who
    had his hair pulled?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't be silly," said Master Hardy.  "Here."  He put his hand in his
    pocket, and producing some nuts offered them over the gate.  At this Miss
    Nugent ceased her capering, and wrath possessed her that the enemy should
    thus misunderstand the gravity of the situation.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, give 'em to Jack, then," pursued the boy; "he won't say no."
</p>
<p>
    This was a distinct reflection on Jack's loyalty, and her indignation was
    not lessened by the fact that she knew it was true.
</p>
<p>
    "Go away from our gate," she stormed.  "If my father catches you, you'll
    suffer."
</p>
<p>
    "Pooh!" said the dare-devil.  He looked up at the house and then, opening
    the gate, strode boldly into the front garden.  Before this intrusion
    Miss Nugent retreated in alarm, and gaining the door-step gazed at him in
    dismay.  Then her face cleared suddenly, and Master Hardy looking over
    his shoulder saw that his retreat was cut off by Mr. Wilks.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't let him hurt me, Sam," entreated Miss Nugent, piteously.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks came into the garden and closed the gate behind him.
</p>
<p>
    "I wasn't going to hurt her," cried Master Hardy, anxiously; "as if I
    should hurt a girl!
</p>
<p>
    "Wot are you doing in our front garden, then?" demanded Mr. Wilks.
</p>
<p>
    He sprang forward suddenly and, catching the boy by the collar with one
    huge hand, dragged him, struggling violently, down the side-entrance into
    the back garden.  Miss Nugent, following close behind, sought to improve
    the occasion.
</p>
<p>
    "See what you get by coming into our garden," she said.
</p>
<p>
    The victim made no reply.  He was writhing strenuously in order to
    frustrate Mr. Wilks's evident desire to arrange him comfortably for the
    administration of the stick he was carrying.  Satisfied at last, the
    ex-steward raised his weapon, and for some seconds plied it briskly.
    Miss Nugent trembled, but sternly repressing sympathy for the sufferer,
    was pleased that the long arm of justice had at last over-taken him.
</p>
<p>
    "Let him go now, Sam," she said; "he's crying."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not," yelled Master Hardy, frantically.
</p>
<p>
    "I can see the tears," declared Miss Nugent, bending.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks plied the rod again until his victim, with a sudden turn,
    fetched him a violent kick on the shin and broke loose.  The ex-steward
    set off in pursuit, somewhat handicapped by the fact that he dare not go
    over flower-beds, whilst Master Hardy was singularly free from such
    prejudices.  Miss Nugent ran to the side-entrance to cut off his retreat.
    She was willing for him to be released, but not to escape, and so it fell
    out that the boy, dodging beneath Mr. Wilks's outspread arms, charged
    blindly up the side-entrance and bowled the young lady over.
</p>
<p>
    There was a shrill squeal, a flutter of white, and a neat pair of button
    boots waving in the air.  Then Miss Nugent, sobbing piteously, rose from
    the puddle into which she had fallen and surveyed her garments.  Mr.
    Wilks surveyed them, too, and a very cursory glance was sufficient to
    show him that the case was beyond his powers.  He took the outraged
    damsel by the hand, and led her, howling lustily, in to the horrified
    Ann.
</p>
<p>
    "My word," said she, gasping.  "Look at your gloves!  Look at your
    frock!"
</p>
<p>
    But Miss Nugent was looking at her knees.  There was only a slight
    redness about the left, but from the right a piece of skin was
    indubitably missing.  This knee she gave Ann instructions to foment with
    fair water of a comfortable temperature, indulging in satisfied
    prognostications as to the fate of Master Hardy when her father should
    see the damage.
</p>
<p>
    The news, when the captain came home, was broken to him by degrees.
    He was first shown the flower-beds by Ann, then Mrs. Kingdom brought in
    various soiled garments, and at the psychological moment his daughter
    bared her knees.
</p>
<p>
    "What will you do to him, father?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    The captain ignored the question in favour of a few remarks on the
    subject of his daughter's behaviour, coupled with stern inquiries as to
    where she learnt such tricks.  In reply Miss Nugent sheltered herself
    behind a list which contained the names of all the young gentlemen who
    attended her kindergarten class and many of the young ladies, and again
    inquired as to the fate of her assailant.
</p>
<p>
    Jack came in soon after, and the indefatigable Miss Nugent produced her
    knees again.  She had to describe the injury to the left, but the right
    spoke for itself.  Jack gazed at it with indignation, and then, without
    waiting for his tea, put on his cap and sallied out again.
</p>
<p>
    He returned an hour later, and instead of entering the sitting-room
    went straight upstairs to bed, from whence he sent down word by the
    sympathetic Ann that he was suffering from a bad headache, which he
    proposed to treat with raw meat applied to the left eye.  His nose, which
    was apparently suffering from sympathetic inflammation, he left to take
    care of itself, that organ bitterly resenting any treatment whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
    He described the battle to Kate and Ann the next day, darkly ascribing
    his defeat to a mysterious compound which Jem Hardy was believed to rub
    into his arms; to a foolish error of judgment at the beginning of the
    fray, and to the sun which shone persistently in his eyes all the time.
    His audience received the explanations in chilly silence.
</p>
<p>
    "And he said it was an accident he knocked you down," he concluded; "he
    said he hoped you weren't hurt, and he gave me some toffee for you."
</p>
<p>
    "What did you do with it?"  demanded Miss Nugent.
</p>
<p>
    "I knew you wouldn't have it," replied her brother, inconsequently, "and
    there wasn't much of it."
</p>
<p>
    His sister regarded him sharply.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't mean to say you ate it?" she screamed.
</p>
<p>
    "Why not?" demanded her brother.  "I wanted comforting, I can tell you."
</p>
<p>
    "I wonder you were not too&mdash;too proud," said Miss Nugent, bitterly.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm never too proud to eat toffee," retorted Jack, simply.
</p>
<p>
    He stalked off in dudgeon at the lack of sympathy displayed by his
    audience, and being still in need of comforting sought it amid the
    raspberry-canes.
</p>
<p>
    His father noted his son's honourable scars, but made no comment.  As to
    any action on his own part, he realized to the full the impotence of a
    law-abiding and dignified citizen when confronted by lawless youth.  But
    Master Hardy came to church no more.  Indeed, the following Sunday he was
    fully occupied on the beach, enacting the part of David, after first
    impressing the raving Mr. Wilks into that of Goliath.

<h2>
    CHAPTER IV
</h2>
<p>
    For the next month or two Master Hardy's existence was brightened by the
    efforts of an elderly steward who made no secret of his intentions of
    putting an end to it.  Mr. Wilks at first placed great reliance on the
    saw that "it is the early bird that catches the worm," but lost faith in
    it when he found that it made no provision for cases in which the worm
    leaning from its bedroom window addressed spirited remonstrances to the
    bird on the subject of its personal appearance.
</p>
<p>
    To the anxious inquiries of Miss Nugent, Mr. Wilks replied that he was
    biding his time.  Every delay, he hinted, made it worse for Master Hardy
    when the day of retribution should dawn, and although she pleaded
    earnestly for a little on account he was unable to meet her wishes.
    Before that day came, however, Captain Nugent heard of the proceedings,
    and after a painful interview with the steward, during which the latter's
    failings by no means escaped attention, confined him to the house.

<p>
    An excellent reason for absenting himself from school was thus denied to
    Master Hardy; but it has been well said that when one door closes another
    opens, and to his great satisfaction the old servant, who had been in
    poor health for some time, suddenly took to her bed and required his
    undivided attention.
</p>
<p>
    He treated her at first with patent medicines purchased at the chemist's,
    a doctor being regarded by both of them as a piece of unnecessary
    extravagance; but in spite of four infallible remedies she got steadily
    worse.  Then a doctor was called in, and by the time Captain Hardy
    returned home she had made a partial recovery, but was clearly incapable
    of further work.  She left in a cab to accept a home with a niece,
    leaving the captain confronted with a problem which he had seen growing
    for some time past.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't make up my mind what to do with you," he observed, regarding his
    son.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm very comfortable," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "You're too comfortable," said his father.
</p>
<p>
    You're running wild.  It's just as well poor old Martha has gone; it has
    brought things to a head."
</p>
<p>
    "We could have somebody else," suggested his son.
</p>
<p>
    The captain shook his head.  "I'll give up the house and send you to
    London to your Aunt Mary," he said, slowly; "she doesn't know you, and
    once I'm at sea and the house given up, she won't be able to send you
    back."
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy, who was much averse to leaving Sunwich and had heard
    accounts of the lady in question which referred principally to her
    strength of mind, made tender inquiries concerning his father's comfort
    while ashore.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll take rooms," was the reply, "and I shall spend as much time as I
    can with you in London.  You want looking after, my son; I've heard all
    about you."
</p>
<p>
    His son, without inquiring as to the nature of the information, denied it
    at once upon principle; he also alluded darkly to his education, and
    shook his head over the effects of a change at such a critical period of
    his existence.
</p>
<p>
    "And you talk too much for your age," was his father's comment when he
    had finished.  "A year or two with your aunt ought to make a nice boy of
    you; there's plenty of room for improvement."
</p>
<p>
    He put his plans in hand at once, and a week before he sailed again had
    disposed of the house.  Some of the furniture he kept for himself; but
    the bulk of it went to his sister as conscience-money.
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy, in very low spirits, watched it taken away.  Big men in
    hob-nailed boots ran noisily up the bare stairs, and came down slowly,
    steering large pieces of furniture through narrow passages, and using
    much vain repetition when they found their hands acting as fenders.  The
    wardrobe, a piece of furniture which had been built for larger premises,
    was a particularly hard nut to crack, but they succeeded at last&mdash;in
    three places.

<p>
    A few of his intimates came down to see the last of him, and Miss Nugent,
    who in some feminine fashion regarded the move as a triumph for her
    family, passed by several times.  It might have been chance, it might
    have been design, but the boy could not help noticing that when the
    piano, the wardrobe, and other fine pieces were being placed in the van,
    she was at the other end of the road a position from which such curios as
    a broken washstand or a two-legged chair never failed to entice her.
</p>
<p>
    It was over at last.  The second van had disappeared, and nothing was
    left but a litter of straw and paper.  The front door stood open and
    revealed desolation.  Miss Nugent came to the gate and stared in
    superciliously.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm glad you're going," she said, frankly.
</p>
<p>
    Master Hardy scarcely noticed her.  One of his friends who concealed
    strong business instincts beneath a sentimental exterior had suggested
    souvenirs and given him a spectacle-glass said to have belonged to Henry
    VIII., and he was busy searching his pockets for an adequate return.
    Then Captain Hardy came up, and first going over the empty house, came
    out and bade his son accompany him to the station.  A minute or two later
    and they were out of sight; the sentimentalist stood on the curb gloating
    over a newly acquired penknife, and Miss Nugent, after being strongly
    reproved by him for curiosity, paced slowly home with her head in the
    air.
</p>
<p>
    Sunwich made no stir over the departure of one of its youthful citizens.
    Indeed, it lacked not those who would have cheerfully parted with two or
    three hundred more.  The boy was quite chilled by the tameness of his
    exit, and for years afterwards the desolate appearance of the platform as
    the train steamed out occurred to him with an odd sense of discomfort.
    In all Sunwich there was only one person who grieved over his departure,
    and he, after keeping his memory green for two years, wrote off fivepence
    as a bad debt and dismissed him from his thoughts.
</p>
<p>
    Two months after the <i>Conqueror</i> had sailed again Captain Nugent obtained
    command of a steamer sailing between London and the Chinese ports.  From
    the gratified lips of Mr. Wilks, Sunwich heard of this new craft, the
    particular glory of which appeared to be the luxurious appointments of
    the steward's quarters.  Language indeed failed Mr. Wilks in describing
    it, and, pressed for details, he could only murmur disjointedly of
    satin-wood, polished brass, and crimson velvet.
</p>
<p>
    Jack Nugent hailed his father's departure with joy.  They had seen a
    great deal of each other during the latter's prolonged stay ashore, and
    neither had risen in the other's estimation in consequence.  He became
    enthusiastic over the sea as a profession for fathers, and gave himself
    some airs over acquaintances less fortunately placed.  In the first flush
    of liberty he took to staying away from school, the education thus lost
    being only partially atoned for by a grown-up style of composition
    engendered by dictating excuses to the easy-going Mrs. Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    At seventeen he learnt, somewhat to his surprise, that his education was
    finished.  His father provided the information and, simply as a matter of
    form, consulted him as to his views for the future.  It was an important
    thing to decide upon at short notice, but he was equal to it, and, having
    suggested gold-digging as the only profession he cared for, was promptly
    provided by the incensed captain with a stool in the local bank.
</p>
<a name="image-9"><!--IMG--></a>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    He occupied it for three weeks, a period of time which coincided to a day
    with his father's leave ashore.  He left behind him his initials cut
    deeply in the lid of his desk, a miscellaneous collection of cheap
    fiction, and a few experiments in book-keeping which the manager
    ultimately solved with red ink and a ruler.
</p>
<p>
    A slight uneasiness as to the wisdom of his proceedings occurred to him
    just before his father's return, but he comforted himself and Kate with
    the undeniable truth that after all the captain couldn't eat him.  He was
    afraid, however, that the latter would be displeased, and, with a
    constitutional objection to unpleasantness, he contrived to be out when
    he returned, leaving to Mrs. Kingdom the task of breaking the news.
</p>
<p>
    The captain's reply was brief and to the point.  He asked his son whether
    he would like to go to sea, and upon receiving a decided answer in the
    negative, at once took steps to send him there.  In two days he had
    procured him an outfit, and within a week Jack Nugent, greatly to his own
    surprise, was on the way to Melbourne as apprentice on the barque <i>Silver
    Stream</i>.
</p>
<p>
    He liked it even less than the bank.  The monotony of the sea was
    appalling to a youth of his tastes, and the fact that the skipper, a man
    who never spoke except to find fault, was almost loquacious with him
    failed to afford him any satisfaction.  He liked the mates no better than
    the skipper, and having said as much one day to the second officer, had
    no reason afterwards to modify his opinions.  He lived a life apart, and
    except for the cook, another martyr to fault-finding, had no society.
</p>
<p>
    In these uncongenial circumstances the new apprentice worked for four
    months as he had never believed it possible he could work.  He was
    annoyed both at the extent and the variety of his tasks, the work of an
    A.B. being gratuitously included in his curriculum.  The end of the
    voyage found him desperate, and after a hasty consultation with the cook
    they deserted together and went up-country.
</p>
<p>
    Letters, dealing mainly with the ideas and adventures of the cook,
    reached Sunwich at irregular intervals, and were eagerly perused by Mrs.
    Kingdom and Kate, but the captain forbade all mention of him.  Then they
    ceased altogether, and after a year or two of unbroken silence Mrs.
    Kingdom asserted herself, and a photograph in her possession, the only
    one extant, exposing the missing Jack in petticoats and sash, suddenly
    appeared on the drawing-room mantelpiece.
</p>
<p>
    The captain stared, but made no comment.  Disappointed in his son, he
    turned for consolation to his daughter, noting with some concern the
    unaccountable changes which that young lady underwent during his
    absences.  He noticed a difference after every voyage.  He left behind
    him on one occasion a nice trim little girl, and returned to find a
    creature all legs and arms.  He returned again and found the arms less
    obnoxious and the legs hidden by a long skirt; and as he complained in
    secret astonishment to his sister, she had developed a motherly manner
    in her dealings with him which was almost unbearable.
</p>
<p>
    "She'll grow out of it soon," said Mrs. Kingdom; "you wait and see."
</p>
<p>
    The captain growled and waited, and found his sister's prognostications
    partly fulfilled.  The exuberance of Miss Nugent's manner was certainly
    modified by time, but she developed instead a quiet, unassuming habit of
    authority which he liked as little.
</p>
<p>
    "She gets made such a fuss of, it's no wonder," said Mrs. Kingdom, with a
    satisfied smile.  "I never heard of a girl getting as much attention as
    she does; it's a wonder her head isn't turned."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh!" said the startled captain; "she'd better not let me see anything of
    it."
</p>
<p>
    "Just so," said Mrs. Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    The captain dwelt on these words and kept his eyes open, and, owing to
    his daughter's benevolent efforts on his behalf, had them fully occupied.
    He went to sea firmly convinced that she would do something foolish in
    the matrimonial line, the glowing terms in which he had overheard her
    describing the charms of the new postman to Mrs. Kingdom filling him with
    the direst forebodings.
</p>
<p>
    It was his last voyage.  An unexpected windfall from an almost forgotten
    uncle and his own investments had placed him in a position of modest
    comfort, and just before Miss Nugent reached her twentieth birthday he
    resolved to spend his declining days ashore and give her those advantages
    of parental attention from which she had been so long debarred.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Wilks, to the inconsolable grief of his ship-mates, left with him.
    He had been for nearly a couple of years in receipt of an annuity
    purchased for him under the will of his mother, and his defection left a
    gap never to be filled among comrades who had for some time regarded him
    in the light of an improved drinking fountain.

<h2>
    CHAPTER V
</h2>
<p>
    On a fine afternoon, some two months after his release from the toils
    of the sea, Captain Nugent sat in the special parlour of The Goblets.
    The old inn offers hospitality to all, but one parlour has by ancient
    tradition and the exercise of self-restraint and proper feeling been
    from time immemorial reserved for the elite of the town.
</p>
<p>
    The captain, confident in the security of these unwritten regulations,
    conversed freely with his peers.  He had been moved to speech by the
    utter absence of discipline ashore, and from that had wandered to the
    growing evil of revolutionary ideas at sea.  His remarks were much
    applauded, and two brother-captains listened with grave respect to a
    disquisition on the wrongs of shipmasters ensuing on the fancied
    rights of sailor men, the only discordant note being struck by the
    harbour-master, a man whose ideas had probably been insidiously sapped
    by a long residence ashore.
</p>
<p>
    "A man before the mast," said the latter, fortifying his moral courage
    with whisky, "is a human being."
</p>
<p>
    "Nobody denies it," said Captain Nugent, looking round.
</p>
<p>
    One captain agreed with him.
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't they act like it, then?" demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
    Nugent and the first captain, struck by the re-mark, thought they had
    perhaps been too hasty in their admission, and waited for number two to
    continue.  They eyed him with silent encouragement.
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't they act like it, then?"  repeated number two, who, being a
    man of few ideas, was not disposed to waste them.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nugent and his friend turned to the harbour-master to see how he
    would meet this poser.
</p>
<p>
    "They mostly do," he replied, sturdily.  "Treat a seaman well, and he'll
    treat you well."
</p>
<p>
    This was rank heresy, and moreover seemed to imply something.  Captain
    Nugent wondered dismally whether life ashore would infect him with the
    same opinions.
</p>
<p>
    "What about that man of mine who threw a belaying-pin at me?"
</p>
<p>
    The harbour-master quailed at the challenge.  The obvious retort was
    offensive.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall carry the mark with me to my grave," added the captain, as a
    further inducement to him to reply.
</p>
<p>
    "I hope that you'll carry it a long time," said the harbour-master,
    gracefully.
</p>
<p>
    "Here, look here, Hall!" expostulated captain number two, starting up.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right, Cooper," said Nugent.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right," said captain number one, and in a rash moment undertook
    to explain.  In five minutes he had clouded Captain Cooper's intellect
    for the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
    He was still busy with his self-imposed task when a diversion was created
    by the entrance of a new arrival.  A short, stout man stood for a moment
    with the handle of the door in his hand, and then came in, carefully
    bearing before him a glass of gin and water.  It was the first time that
    he had set foot there, and all understood that by this intrusion Mr.
    Daniel Kybird sought to place sea-captains and other dignitaries on a
    footing with the keepers of slop-shops and dealers in old clothes.  In
    the midst of an impressive silence he set his glass upon the table and,
    taking a chair, drew a small clay pipe from his pocket.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Aghast at the intrusion, the quartette conferred with their eyes, a
    language which is perhaps only successful in love.  Captain Cooper, who
    was usually moved to speech by externals, was the first to speak.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got a sty coming on your eye, Hall," he remarked.
</p>
<p>
    "I daresay."
</p>
<p>
    "If anybody's got a needle," said the captain, who loved minor
    operations.
</p>
<p>
    Nobody heeded him except the harbour-master, and he muttered something
    about beams and motes, which the captain failed to understand.  The
    others were glaring darkly at Mr. Kybird, who had taken up a newspaper
    and was busy perusing it.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you looking for anybody?" demanded Captain Nugent, at last.
</p>
<p>
    "No," said Mr. Kybird, looking at him over the top of his paper.
</p>
<p>
    "What have you come here for, then?" inquired the captain.
</p>
<p>
    "I come 'ere to drink two o' gin cold," returned Mr. Kybird, with a
    dignity befitting the occupation.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, suppose you drink it somewhere else," suggested the captain.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kybird had another supposition to offer.  "Suppose I don't?" he
    remarked.  "I'm a respect-able British tradesman, and my money is as good
    as yours.  I've as much right to be here as you 'ave.  I've never done
    anything I'm ashamed of!"
</p>
<p>
    "And you never will," said Captain Cooper's friend, grimly, "not if you
    live to be a hundred."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kybird looked surprised at the tribute.  "Thankee," he said,
    gratefully.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, we don't want you here," said Captain Nugent.  "We prefer your
    room to your company."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kybird leaned back in his chair and twisted his blunt features into
    an expression of withering contempt.  Then he took up a glass and drank,
    and discovered too late that in the excitement of the moment he had made
    free with the speaker's whisky.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't apologize," interrupted the captain; "it's soon remedied."
</p>
<p>
    He took the glass up gingerly and flung it with a crash into the
    fireplace.  Then he rang the bell.
</p>
<p>
    "I've smashed a dirty glass," he said, as the bar-man entered.  "How
    much?"
</p>
<p>
    The man told him, and the captain, after a few stern remarks about
    privacy and harpies, left the room with his friends, leaving the
    speechless Mr. Kybird gazing at the broken glass and returning evasive
    replies to the inquiries of the curious Charles.
</p>
<p>
    He finished his gin and water slowly.  For months he had been screwing up
    his courage to carry that room by assault, and this was the result.  He
    had been insulted almost in the very face of Charles, a youth whose
    reputation as a gossip was second to none in Sunwich.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you know what I should do if I was you?" said that worthy, as he
    entered the room again and swept up the broken glass.
</p>
<p>
    "I do not," said Mr. Kybird, with lofty indifference.
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't come 'ere again, that's what I should do," said Charles,
    frankly.  "Next time he'll throw you in the fireplace."
</p>
<p>
    "Ho," said the heated Mr. Kybird.  "Ho, will he?  I'd like to see 'im.
    I'll make 'im sorry for this afore I've done with 'im.  I'll learn 'im to
    insult a respectable British tradesman.  I'll show him who's who."
</p>
<p>
    "What'll you do?" inquired the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Never you mind," said Mr. Kybird, who was not in a position to satisfy
    his curiosity&mdash;"never you mind.  You go and get on with your work,
    Charles, and p'r'aps by the time your moustache 'as grown big enough to
    be seen, you'll 'ear something."
</p>
<p>
    "I 'eard something the other day," said the bar-man, musingly; "about you
    it was, but I wouldn't believe it."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot was it?" demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Nothing much," replied Charles, standing with his hand on the door-knob,
    "but I wouldn't believe it of you; I said I couldn't."
</p>
<p>
    "Wot&mdash;was&mdash;it?" insisted Mr. Kybird.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, they said you once gave a man a fair price for a pair of trousers,"
    said the barman, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
    He closed the door behind him softly, and Mr. Kybird, after a brief
    pause, opened it again and, more softly still, quitted the precincts of
    The Goblets, and stepped across the road to his emporium.

<p>
    Captain Nugent, in happy ignorance of the dark designs of the wardrobe
    dealer, had also gone home.  He was only just beginning to realize the
    comparative unimportance of a retired shipmaster, and the knowledge was
    a source of considerable annoyance to him.  No deferential mates listened
    respectfully to his instructions, no sturdy seaman ran to execute his
    commands or trembled mutinously at his wrath.  The only person in the
    wide world who stood in awe of him was the general servant Bella, and she
    made no attempt to conceal her satisfaction at the attention excited by
    her shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
    He paused a moment at the gate and then, walking slowly up to the door,
    gave it the knock of a master.  A full minute passing, he knocked again,
    remembering with some misgivings his stern instructions of the day before
    that the door was to be attended by the servant and by nobody else.  He
    had seen Miss Nugent sitting at the window as he passed it, but in the
    circumstances the fact gave him no comfort.  A third knock was followed
    by a fourth, and then a distressed voice upstairs was heard calling
    wildly upon the name of Bella.
</p>
<p>
    At the fifth knock the house shook, and a red-faced maid with her
    shoulders veiled in a large damp towel passed hastily down the staircase
    and, slipping the catch, passed more hastily still upstairs again,
    affording the indignant captain a glimpse of a short striped skirt as it
    turned the landing.
</p>
<p>
    "Is there any management at all in this house?" he inquired, as he
    entered the room.
</p>
<p>
    "Bella was dressing," said Miss Nugent, calmly, "and you gave orders
    yesterday that nobody else was to open the door."
</p>
<p>
    "Nobody else when she's available," qualified her father, eyeing her
    sharply.  "When I give orders I expect people to use their common sense.
    Why isn't my tea ready?  It's five o'clock."
</p>
<p>
    "The clock's twenty minutes fast," said Kate.  "Who's been meddling with
    it?" demanded her father, verifying the fact by his watch.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Nugent shook her head.  "It's gained that since you regulated it
    last night," she said, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
    The captain threw himself into an easy-chair, and with one eye on the
    clock, waited until, at five minutes to the hour by the right time, a
    clatter of crockery sounded from the kitchen, and Bella, still damp, came
    in with the tray.  Her eye was also on the clock, and she smirked weakly
    in the captain's direction as she saw that she was at least two minutes
    ahead of time.  At a minute to the hour the teapot itself was on the
    tray, and the heavy breathing of the handmaiden in the kitchen was
    audible to all.
</p>
<p>
    "Punctual to the minute, John," said Mrs. Kingdom, as she took her seat
    at the tray.  "It's wonderful how that girl has improved since you've
    been at home.  She isn't like the same girl."
</p>
<p>
    She raised the teapot and, after pouring out a little of the contents,
    put it down again and gave it another two minutes.  At the end of that
    time, the colour being of the same unsatisfactory paleness, she set the
    pot down and was about to raise the lid when an avalanche burst into the
    room and, emptying some tea into the pot from a canister-lid, beat a
    hasty re-treat.
</p>
<p>
    "Good tea and well-trained servants," muttered the captain to his plate.
    "What more can a man want?"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Kingdom coughed and passed his cup; Miss Nugent, who possessed a
    healthy appetite, serenely attacked her bread and butter; conversation
    languished.
</p>
<p>
    "I suppose you've heard the news, John?" said his sister.
</p>
<p>
    "I daresay I have," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "Strange he should come back after all these years," said Mrs. Kingdom;
    "though, to be sure, I don't know why he shouldn't.  It's his native
    place, and his father lives here."
</p>
<p>
    "Who are you talking about?" inquired the captain.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, James Hardy," replied his sister.  "I thought you said you had
    heard.  He's coming back to Sunwich and going into partnership with old
    Swann, the shipbroker.  A very good thing for him, I should think."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not interested in the doings of the Hardys," said the captain,
    gruffly.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure I'm not," said his sister, defensively.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nugent proceeded with his meal in silence.  His hatred of Hardy
    had not been lessened by the success which had attended that gentleman's
    career, and was not likely to be improved by the well-being of Hardy
    junior.  He passed his cup for some more tea, and, with a furtive glance
    at the photograph on the mantelpiece, wondered what had happened to his
    own son.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't suppose I should know him if I saw him," continued Mrs. Kingdom,
    addressing a respectable old arm-chair; "London is sure to have changed
    him."
</p>
<p>
    "Is this water-cress?" inquired the captain, looking up from his plate.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Why?" said Mrs. Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
    "I only wanted information," said her brother, as he deposited the salad
    in question in the slop-basin.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Kingdom, with a resigned expression, tried to catch her niece's eye
    and caught the captain's instead.  Miss Nugent happening to glance up saw
    her fascinated by the basilisk glare of the master of the house.
</p>
<p>
    "Some more tea, please," she said.
</p>
<p>
    Her aunt took her cup, and in gratitude for the diversion picked out the
    largest lumps of sugar in the basin.
</p>
<p>
    "London changes so many people," mused the persevering lady, stirring her
    tea.  "I've noticed it before.  Why it is I can't say, but the fact
    remains.  It seems to improve them altogether.  I dare say that young
    Hardy&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "Will you understand that I won't have the Hardys mentiond in my house?"
    said the captain, looking up.  "I'm not interested in their business, and
    I will not have it discussed here."
</p>
<p>
    "As you please, John," said his sister, drawing herself up.  "It's your
    house and you are master here.  I'm sure I don't want to discuss them.
    Nothing was farther from my thoughts.  You understand what your father
    says, Kate?"
</p>
<p>
    "Perfectly," said Miss Nugent.  "When the desire to talk about the Hardys
    becomes irresistible we must go for a walk."
</p>
<p>
    The captain turned in his chair and regarded his daughter steadily.  She
    met his gaze with calm affection.
</p>
<p>
    "I wish you were a boy," he growled.
</p>
<p>
    "You're the only man in Sunwich who wishes that," said Miss Nugent,
    complacently, "and I don't believe you mean it.  If you'll come a little
    closer I'll put my head on your shoulder and convert you."
</p>
<p>
    "Kate!" said Mrs. Kingdom, reprovingly.
</p>
<p>
    "And, talking about heads," said Miss Nugent, briskly, "reminds me that I
    want a new hat.  You needn't look like that; good-looking daughters
    always come expensive."
</p>
<p>
    She moved her chair a couple of inches in his direction and smiled
    alluringly.  The captain shifted uneasily; prudence counselled flight,
    but dignity forbade it.  He stared hard at Mrs. Kingdom, and a smile of
    rare appreciation on that lady's face endeavoured to fade slowly and
    naturally into another expression.  The chair came nearer.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't be foolish," said the captain, gruffly.
</p>
<p>
    The chair came still nearer until at last it touched his, and then Miss
    Nugent, with a sigh of exaggerated content, allowed her head to sink
    gracefully on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Most comfortable shoulder in Sunwich," she murmured; "come and try the
    other, aunt, and perhaps you'll get a new bonnet."
</p>

</center>
<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Mrs. Kingdom hastened to reassure her brother.  She would almost as soon
    have thought of putting her head on the block.  At the same time it was
    quite evident that she was taking a mild joy in his discomfiture and
    eagerly awaiting further developments.
</p>
<p>
    "When you are tired of this childish behaviour, miss," said the captain,
    stiffly&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    There was a pause.  "Kate!" said Mrs. Kingdom, in tones of mild reproof,
    how can you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Very good," said the captain, we'll see who gets tired of it first.  "I'm
    in no hurry."
</p>
<p>
    A delicate but unmistakable snore rose from his shoulder in reply.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
